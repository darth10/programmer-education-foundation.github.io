      <h1>The Programmer Education Foundation</h1>
      
      <p>
         Web developers are almost entirely self-taught; even if they attended
         university for a computer science degree, it is almost certain they
         never had a course teach them about XSS or SQL injection.
      </p>
      <p>
         We aim to seek out developers who are unwittingly making fatal
         mistakes, and educate them so they may continue on a path towards
         being a great programmer.
      </p>
      <p>
         Because examples are the best way to educate, our lessons take the
         form of pull requests - it is only through the combined background
         information and conrete example we may expect results.
      </p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      
      <h3>SQL Injection</h3>
      
      <p>
         Allowing user data to leak into your database queries unfiltered, so
         an attacker can perform arbitrary commands on your database.

         information on how to avoid this in different languages.

         href="https://github.com/programmer-education-foundation/volunteers/issues/new">Open
         an issue</a> on the volunteers repository and we'll add you to the
         organization.  Please list any language-groups you'd like to be a part
         of (e.g. PHP) if you'd like to get pinged periodically for advice.
      </p>
      <p>
         Once you're a part of the organization, find a project with a problem
         and fork it to PEF.  Fix the problem, send in a pull request, and feel
         good about yourself.  See <a
         href="https://github.com/d7my11/alwaleed/pull/1">our first pull
         request</a> for an example of the type of thing we're looking for.
